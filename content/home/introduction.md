title: About the Lab
---
The Monir lab studies marine microbial diversity, evolution and ecology through a variety of field, lab, and bioinformatic techniques. Specifically, we are interested in studying the role of giant ocean viruses in marine ecological processes and evolutionary history. How these viruses interact with their hosts and are involved in large biogeochemical processes is still relatively unknown. If you are interested in joining the lab, feel free to [contact us]({{<relref "/contact/>}}).
